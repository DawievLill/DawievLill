- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on estimation for DSGE models in `Julia` (mostly MCMC right now)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with work at the intersection of deep learning and heterogeneous agent models in macroeconomics
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: dvanlill@sun.ac.za 
- âš¡ Fun fact: You pronounce my name Dah-Vee Fun Lill

Here are some of the things I am currently learning more about
