### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, my name is Dawie van Lill 

Here are some things to know about me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on topics related to economic inequality with application to South Africa
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m also working on models that integrate financial frictions into a dynamic general equilibrium setting
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with work at the intersection of deep learning and heterogeneous agent models in macroeconomics
- âš¡ Fun fact: You pronounce my name Dah-Vee Fun Lill

Here are some of the things I am currently learning more about

- Programming. Primarily in `Julia` and `Python`
- Computational methods for dynamic general equilibrium models
- Functional analysis and measure theory
- Scientific machine learning
- Cloud computing (`GCP` and `AWS`)
- Continous-time heterogeneous agent modelling

You are free to use the code for my courses in any way you wish. I have borrowed from so many people that I feel it is only fitting to make things freely available. Most of the notes are a work in progress. I try to learn as I put notes together, so there might be mistakes.
